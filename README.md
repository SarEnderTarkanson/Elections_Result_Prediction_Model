# Elections_Result_Prediction_Model

This is a linear regression model that I trained in order to predict the election results for the ruling party (AKP) in Turkey.

The model takes the macroeconomic indicators in the Turkish economy as input data.

It is able to predict the results with less than 3 % error with an R-squared score of 0.825. I believe the model can be further developed with more data and a more complex model, so there is still room for more improvement.
